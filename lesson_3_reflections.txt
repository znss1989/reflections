When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  That would happen when I'd like to make the poject public for anybody to review, or let it be eaiser to checked from other ends.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	The remote changes might not be the proper version to work on locally, for example the remote changes may concer about a bug fixation, while the local work focuses on a new feature.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	The fork is to copy a repository from Github right on the server, under your name. While clones is not limited for its source and destinations. A branch must be in the same repository. Fork is used when having no right to change the original repository. Branch is to develop a different try of the project while maintain the current work. Clone is a copy for all times.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It is good to have a local copy of the latest known remote repository, so that the user can work efficiently offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	That would involve a lot of redundant conversation on conflicting versions by all sides. Of course, the collaboration on Github would be much easier, to maintainning a master working branch while all team members fixing the bugs and developing new features on the new project.
