When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  That would happen when I'd like to make the poject public for anybody to review, or let it be eaiser to checked from other ends.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	The remote changes might not be the proper version to work on locally, for example the remote changes may concer about a bug fixation, while the local work focuses on a new feature.
